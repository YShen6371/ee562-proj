# ee562-proj
Project of ee562, 2022 fall

We aim to work on modified version of project idea No.1, MNIST: Handwritten digit recognition. Instead of using original MNIST dataset, we will use Fashion MNIST dataset, which is:
 - direct drop-in replacement of MNIST
 - not that easy as MNIST and not overused
 - able to present modern CV tasks

This dataset consists of 10 classes of fashion items, including T-shirts, coats and bags, etc. We will adopt deep learning with 3 different neural network structures to perform the classification, including VGG, ResNet and Inception.
